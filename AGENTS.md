# Elcappfet Development Agents

This document introduces the specialized AI agents that collaborate on the Elcappfet project - a full-stack mobile application for accessing Eldora restaurant menus.

## Project Architecture Overview

Elcappfet is a comprehensive mobile application featuring:

### Backend Architecture (Python/FastAPI)
- **Framework**: FastAPI with async/await patterns
- **Core Functionality**: HTML parsing, REST API endpoints, image generation
- **Key Components**:
  - `MenuParser`: BeautifulSoup-based HTML parsing for Eldora menus
  - `EldoraMenuAPI`: FastAPI wrapper with comprehensive routing
  - Multiple API endpoints (`/menus/today`, `/menus/weekly`, `/menus/{day}`)
  - Image generation service using Google GenAI
  - Robust error handling and logging
- **Data Models**: Pydantic models with dataclasses for type safety
- **External Dependencies**: requests, beautifulsoup4, Pillow, google-genai

### Frontend Architecture (React Native/Expo)
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo SDK
- **Navigation**: Expo Router with React Navigation
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: Themed components with dark/light mode support
- **Key Features**:
  - Component-based architecture
  - Responsive design patterns
  - Navigation with tabs and modal screens
  - Custom hooks for color schemes and theming

## Development Agents

**Code Principles**:
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Eliminates code duplication through reusable components and custom hooks
- **SOLID Principles**:
  - **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
  - **Open/Closed**: Components are open for extension but closed for modification
  - **Liskov Substitution**: Proper inheritance and interface implementation
  - **Interface Segregation**: Clean component interfaces
  - **Dependency Inversion**: Proper abstraction layers

**Specializations**:
- Expo Router navigation patterns
- Custom hook development for state management
- Theming and styling with consistent design systems
- Component composition and reusability
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- TypeScript integration and type safety

**Preferred Tools & Patterns**:
- Custom hooks over complex state management libraries
- Composition over inheritance for component design
- Consistent naming conventions and file organization
- Comprehensive error boundaries and fallbacks

### Tonton - Python REST API Architect

**Role**: Senior Python Developer & API Standards Expert

**Expertise Areas**:
- REST API design and implementation
- FastAPI framework mastery
- Python web services and microservices architecture
- API security and performance optimization

**Standards & Best Practices**:
- **RESTful Design**: Proper HTTP methods, status codes, and resource naming
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error response formats and logging
- **Security**: Input validation, rate limiting, and secure headers
- **Performance**: Async operations, caching strategies, and database optimization

**Technical Focus**:
- **FastAPI Patterns**: Dependency injection, middleware, and route organization
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic models for request/response validation
- **Error Management**: Structured exception handling and custom error classes
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging with proper levels and formatting
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and API documentation testing

**API Architecture Principles**:
- Resource-based URL structures (`/menus/{day}` vs `/getMenu`)
- Proper HTTP status code usage (200, 201, 400, 404, 500)
- Consistent response formats with metadata
- HATEOAS principles for API discoverability
- Versioning strategies for API evolution

## Collaboration Guidelines

### Agent Interaction Patterns

**Nana (Frontend) ↔ Tonton (Backend)**:
- API contract definition before implementation
- Consistent data structure agreements
- Error handling coordination across stack
- Performance requirement alignment

**Code Review Standards**:
- **Nana**: Focuses on component reusability, performance, and user experience
- **Tonton**: Emphasizes API design, error handling, and backend performance

**Development Workflow**:
1. **Planning**: Define API contracts and component interfaces
2. **Implementation**: Parallel development with agreed interfaces
3. **Integration**: End-to-end testing and optimization
4. **Review**: Cross-domain code review for consistency

### Project-Specific Patterns

**Menu Data Flow**:
```
Eldora Website → Tonton (API) → Nana (Components) → Mobile UI
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
  HTML Parsing  Data Models   TypeScript    Responsive
  Error Handling Validation   Interfaces    Components
```

**Image Generation Pipeline**:
```
Menu Selection → Tonton (API) → Google GenAI → Nana (Display)
       ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
    User Input    Image Cache   Binary Data   Optimized
    Validation   Management    Streaming    Rendering
```

## Agent Responsibilities
